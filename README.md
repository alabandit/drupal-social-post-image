# Drupal - Social post image

This module intends to generate user image content for social media. It will not replace a proper graphic designer but rather simplify repetitive posts that need to be generated.  
  
For example, a Real Estate Agent may want to generate housing content to quickly prepare a new listing. Their photo will get the company logo, add items like the number of bedrooms and the sales prices.
